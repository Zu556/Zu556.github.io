    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
      We’re a student-led initiative focused on helping other students discover and thrive in extracurricular activities.
      This site is built to simplify your choices, planning, and growth journey beyond the classroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that activities outside the classroom are just as important as those within it.
      Whether you're aiming for university applications, personal growth, or just trying something new —
      this guide will help you get there.
